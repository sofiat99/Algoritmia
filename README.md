# Algorithm
Algorithm proposals for latency solution in order processing for the company Stratton Oakmont.

For the development of this solution, an optimization was carried out in the code, changing the type of data previously implemented, the cycles defined during the process and making one of multiprocessing to be able to divide the work into two processes at the same time; reducing execution time by approximately 49 percent; where previously it took 511.2628 seconds to execute 1000 orders, this solution will take 246.544 seconds.

To run the program, it is necessary to clone it to the location you want, to do this execute the following command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/sofiat99/Algoritmia.git
    
Once cloned, it sits above the project folder

    cd \Algoritmia\
    
Run the project with the command

    python prueba_algoritmica.py
